# Text Reverser  
An AutoHotkey script to reverse text. Really for no other reason than, I think it's hard to so I'm going to get something to do it for me.  
## Usage  
### Using The standalone EXE:  
This program can be used without any autohotkey interpreter.  
1. Download the EXE in this repository (Either by `git clone` or other means)  
2. Run the EXE once downloaded. It will stay in the background once run, you do not need to run it everytime you want to use it  
3. Select the text you want to reverse    
4. Press the key combo `ALT+F10` to reverse the whole selected text, or press `ALT+F11` to reverse the selected text word by word. (See examples if unsure)  
    
### Using the AHK file:  
To use the AHK file, follow the [autohotkey documentation for running scripts](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Program.htm#run).   
## Examples  
1. Reversing all of the selected text:

2. Reversing each word individually:

## Notes  
When I tried to use this on Linux via Wine, I couldn't get it to work, therefore I'm not going to claim if it does or doesn't. I won't provide support for that.  
If you do happen to spot any problems or errors that are independent from your environment and are reproducable, please feel free to leave an issue.
